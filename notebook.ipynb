We love to think of this pad as almost a 'one-step' pad; as it's versatility can truly transform such as wide range of paintwork types; and is amazingly comfortable and easy to use.These new RUPES pads have a patented new design that has been designed and manufactured in Italy. This new design offers a lower profile pad height that effectively optimises the transfer of heat from the tool to the application surface (resulting in a more effective defect removal and higher quality finish); and also an all new contour profile which helps maintain safe machine operation near panel edges. These features combined improve the consistency of pad movement in curves and contours by reducing pad distortion.This line of products is designed as a unified system, compatible with any random orbital tool movement; or gear-driven.Fine:The most versatile pad for moderate to fine defect removal, or final finishing after heavy compounding. Technical Specifications:   Velcro Interface √   Ømm 150/180   Fine √  Downloads:     RUPES BigFoot Catalogue   D-A Series Brochure  \n",

      " This new assembly is able to significantly enhance the vacuum performance and efficiency. Thanks to a higher internal section, flow rate and suction capacity have increased, optimizing performance of the connected dust extraction system. The terminal part of the hose is conical, for better ergonomics and handling. This innovation improves the movement of the sander on work surfaces The conical section ensures better vacuum performances and a better handling. The flow rate has been increased in the last section, where the hose with smaller section is connected to the tool, thus increasing performances and extraction capacity The efficient conductivity of the material allows the hose to dissipate the electrostatic charges generated during the sanding process much more efficiently than a standard hose. This RUPES hose solution is an ideal product that can be used in potentially explosive applications The new design in combination with the improved materials and the conic section have increased the flexibility of the new hose assembly. Better handling and easy maneuverability in every application represent a huge benefit for the operatorWith an innovative production process, RUPES has created this new hose assembly consisting of 2 hoses heat sealed to each other, one external and smaller reserved for the compressed air pipe or the electric cord, and a bigger one for vacuum and dust extraction. Specifications: Length: 5m\n",

      "Replacement Ceramic Element Assembly for 220-240V Model 7 Welders Dimensions: 11\" x 2\" x 4\"This is the replacement element for the Mini-Weld Model 7 Airless Plastic Welder.  The previous design had a Ni-Chrome wire that, like a light bulb, would seem to burn out at the most inopportune time.  This design, however, has a ceramic element that lasts WAY longer.  In fact, Polyvance put this element on their cycle-tester to see how long it would last.  The cycle tester would turn on the element for 30 minutes, then turn off the element for 30 minutes.  This cycle happened 24 times a day for 9 months (a total of 6,500 cycles) and the element never burned out.Here is another great thing about this element.  In the unlikely event that the ceramic core burns out, you can replace just the ceramic core!  Of course, what is more likely to happen is that the ceramic element will break if you happen to drop the element assembly.Polyvance got tired of dealing with suppliers who said \"this is what we have to offer.  Take it or leave it.\"  So, they started from scratch and designed their own.   Polyvance wanted an element that would last a long time, so they designed it with a ceramic element. They wanted an element that had a replacable heater so that you don't have to buy the entire assembly if the heater breaks or burns out. They wanted an element that gets hot quickly and has enough power to keep the element hot, so they made it 200 watts.  This has WAY more power than most off-the-shelf elements.  Most off-the-shelf elements are typically in the 40W to 80W range.FAQHow many ohms resistance should the element show on a multi-meter when I test my element?The resistance of the element should be in the range of 190 to 200 ohms.I have an older Model 6 welder and the element is burned out.  May I replace that element with the Ceramic element?Yes!  The 6012 Ceramic element will wire up to a Model 6 welder with no modifications necessary.How to change the entire element assemblyHow to change the ceramic heater in your element:\n",

      "BUMPER DENT REMOVAL ROLLERSBumpers are often dented or distorted when they suffer a collision. Polyvance’s 6148 Bumper Rollers Kit makes the dent removal process much easier. The Bumper Rollers kit consists of three heavy-duty rollers – one wide and flat, one ball-shaped, and one with a sharp edge which allows you to reshape body lines. To use the rollers, first heat the bumper with a heat gun to soften the plastic. Once the entire area is too hot to touch, begin pushing with the Bumper Rollers. Use the different rollers to reestablish your body lines, and massage the distortions around the edges of the original dent where the plastic was stretched. You may also use the blunt end of the handle to push the dents as needed. After letting the plastic cool, sand the area with 80 grit in a DA sander to reveal any high and low spots. Heat the bumper if necessary, then continue to work the low spots up and the high spots down to get the profile back. In the end, you should be able to work the dent out with little to no filler.The Bumper Rollers have other uses as well:On sheet metal, use a paint pen to mark the location of the damage on the backside. Use the rollers to push out the dents and redefine the body lines. You can remove a majority of the dent faster and easier with the Bumper Rollers Kit than with a hammer and dolly.When pressing the adhesive sound deadening pad down into a trunk floor panel, use the different roller shapes to get into all of the corners and depressions of the panel. This allows you to press out all of the air bubbles and give you an OEM finished appearance.Contents: 1 flat, wide roller - for use on large areas 1 round roller - for use on round radiuses 1 roller with a sharp edge - for use on sharp body linesHow to Use the Bumper Rollers:     Downloads:   \t\t\tInfo Sheet  \n",

      "With the Kayak and Canoe, or \"KC\" Welder Pro, you can create permanent repairs to your cracked kayak or cracked canoe. This kayak repair kit / canoe repair kit comes with everything you need.KC Welder Pro Kit Contents: One heavy duty 200 watt element with a long cord One flat welding tip that makes repairs easy 10 feet of plastic welding strips in the color you choose Stainless steel reinforcing meshLDPE or HDPE?The difference between LDPE (low density polyethylene) and HDPE (high density polyethylene) is the length of the molecule chains. HDPE has longer molecular chains than LDPE and the melting temperature of HDPE is often higher than that of LDPE.LDPE's lower melting temperature usually makes using it as filler rod easier-to-use than welding HDPE filler rod to HDPE plastics.HDPE is also \"tougher\" and more abrasion resistant than LDPE, but the practical difference is minimal when doing repair work. If you need the best wear characteristics and can live with making slower, more difficult welds, use HDPE rod. In most cases, we see better quality welds when using LDPE rod for typical crack or hole repair on boat hulls and ATV plastics.How to Use the KC Welder Kayak Patch KitHow to Repair a Kayak with an Airless Plastic Welder  Quit Making Temporary Repairs!You may have tried to use different methods to repair your kayak or canoe using some creative techniqes. Techniques like... Liquid Nails (it peels off quickly) Glue Gun (Doesn't \"burn in\" well and quickly peels away) Rivet an aluminum plate and caulk the edge and hope that it holds. (Gets scraped off from the first rock you go over.) Sandwich a piece of rubber between an alumium plate and the kayak with rivets (or screws)Those techniques you've tried must not have worked, or you wouldn't be looking at this page now. The KC Welder Pro allows you to make permanent repairs.Step-by-step InstructionsStep 1This is a typical crack that you might find on the bottom of a kayak. The first thing you need to do in any plastic repair is to clean the plastic. Use soap and water to remove any water soluble contaminants. If there are any contaminants, like tar, grease, or sticker residue, that won't come off easily with soap and water, then use one of Polyvance's plastic cleaners.Realign the plastic if is has overlapped itself.  Step 2To maximize the strength of the repair, it helps to embed some wire mesh into the plastic. It is similar to putting rebar in concrete. Cut some of the included wire mesh to span the crack about an inch on side. On this particular repair, we had to fold the mesh because the crack was on a corner.  Step 3Using the KC Welder, melt the wire mesh into the plastic. This is similar to putting rebar in concrete. It makes the repair a lot stronger. Sometimes, the mesh wants to \"pop out\" of the plastic before the plastic cools. If that happens, use a screwdriver or another tool to hold the mesh into the plastic until the plastic re-solidifies.  Step 4Here is what it will look like once the mesh has been melted into the plastic.  Step 5Apply the filler rod by pre-melting one side of the rod.  Step 6Flip the filler rod over so that the melted side is toward the plastic that you are working on.  Step 7Cut the tip of the rod off by melting through it with the edge of the welder tip.  Step 8Spread the melted rod while pushing it through the mesh. You may need to apply an extra layer of rod after pushing it through the mesh. Get the plastic hot enough so that the new melted plastic melts together with the existing plastic.  Step 9Continue applying plastic until the crack is repaired completely.  Cosmetic Restoration Video \n",

      "Polyvance Padded Dash Filler is formulated from special polyester resins that increase adhesion to vinyl and other plastic substrates. Flexible resins are used to give the flexibility required to withstand the expansion and contraction brought about by extreme temperatures. It has excellent filling qualities with shaping, sanding and feather edging accomplished with ease. This makes an excellent filler for padded dash repair since the sanding is normally done by hand. Each can contains 8 fl. oz. (236 ml) of padded dash filler and comes with a 2 fl. oz. (59 ml) tube of cream hardener.     Downloads:    Safety Data Sheet  How to Repair a Padded Dashboard?When restoring older cars, it is often too expensive to replace a cracked dashboard. And, that is assuming a new dash board is available. In cases where new parts are too expensive, too difficult to find, or, impossible to find, you will need to restore what is already there. The padded dashboard on this 1971 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser is a good example.Step 1As you can see, this dashboard has a hole that needs to be repaired. Most old cars and some new cars have dashboards made from vinyl over urethane foam. Over time in the sun, the vinyl gets brittle and the dash board gets cracks. Many newer dashboard don't have any foam at all. Instead, they are made from injection molded TPO or ABS. But, these dashboards can also get cracked or get holes from exposure to the sun.  Step 2Use 80 grit or 180 grit sandpaper to bevel into the damage. Make sure that you sand out any dried-out and crusty foam, too.  Step 3Melt some of the polyurethane welding rod into the void that was created when you sanded out the crusty, dried out foam. The urethane rod is very flexible and closely simulates the urethane foam. Turn the temperature all of the way up and the melted rod come out bubbly. Some of the bubbles remain encapsulated within the polyurethane and simulates the foam even more. Overfill the hole slighly. You will be sanding it down and it is better to overfill slightly than having to find out that you need to melt more polyurethane rod into the hole after you have sanded it. IMPORTANT NOTE:If you have one of the newer dashboards that don't have any foam, you may skip this step.  Step 4This is what it looks like after filling the hole.  Step 5Use 80 grit sandpaper to sand the urethane level with the surrounding area. The urethane is very stretchy and elastic so, if you use really short strokes when you sand, it may just stretch back and forth rather than getting ground away. A good way to prevent the back-and-forth stretching is to put your thumb on top of the sandpaper over the area that you need to sand. Then, pull the sandpaper while maintaining downward pressure with your thumb over the urethane.  Step 6This is what the damaged area looks like after the urethane welding rod was sanded down.  Step 7Mix some Padded Dash Filler with the cream hardener according to the instructions. Use a spreader to apply the Padded Dash Filler to the damaged area.  Step 8Allow time for the Padded Dash Filler to cure. Sand it smooth starting with 180 grit sandpaper and then 320 grit sand paper.  Step 9This is how it looks after sanding smooth the Padded Dash Filler.  Step 10Spray on Flextex VT. You may want to spray the texture coating on something else first. You will get different size texture depending on your spray gun settings and how much you reduce (dilute) the Flextex with lacquer thinner.  Step 11Lightly scuff the texture coating with a scuff pad to remove any high spots. Sometimes the texture coating can be a little bit rough after it is applied.  Step 12This is how the dash pad looks before the top coat is applied.  Step 13A topcoat was applied to match the original color.  Step 14Here is the finished dash repair and restoration. As you can see, the dashboard looks great. Now, for the rest of the car.  \n",

The RUPES Mark III Bigfoot Random Orbital Polisher uses superior Italian craftsmanship to create a tool that is built to last.Innovative design makes the LHR21 Mark III the perfect machine for large polishing jobs. The RUPES LHR21 BigFoot Mark III Random Orbital Polisher gets its name from its massive, industry leading 21mm orbit. Consider this: a conventional random orbital polisher has an orbit between 4 and 8mm.This gives the LHR 21 a huge advantage while working on large panels because it enables you to polish a significantly larger area, reducing your overall time and increasing profits This means you’ll be able to remove swirls, scratches, water spots and other paint defects in considerably less time. It is the perfectionist’s choice for swirl-free paint!The highly efficient motor of the Mark III BigFoot Random Orbital Polisher produces a speed range of 3000 to 4500 RPMs. The specially engineered motor, generates high levels of torque while requiring just 500 watts of input. This results in RUPES offering the most efficient motor in random orbital polishing today. The motor on these polishers are so efficient compared with other polishers on the market, performing better than these polishers that push up to 1100w.The RUPES LHR 21 utilizes a 6 inch hook and loop backing plate designed to accommodate 6.5 inch and 7 inch pads – perfect for polishing horizontal and large body panels.  The polisher ensures a perfect finish with its random orbital motion and exceptionally large throw. One of the biggest advantages of the LHR 21 is that no swirls or holograms are instilled into the paint as you polish. A conventional rotary/circular polisher, while very effective at polishing paint to remove defects, can leave swirls and holograms in the finish as a result of its direct drive, circular motion. Simply put, the RUPES LHR 21 BigFoot Mark III Random Orbital Polisher leaves you with a perfect finish that’s free of swirls and holograms – all without the risk of burning through the paint.

      "The evolution of BigFoot continues.  Built to handle any detailing situation, the latest BigFoot Mark III Polisher is the new frontier of detailing.Built with everything that made the BigFoot Polishers legendary in the detailing community, the 'Mark III' has taken on the successful elements of the original 'BigFoot' machines and improved upon them. The RUPES LHR21 MKIII Bigfoot Random Orbital Polisher will take your detailing possibilities to the next level of perfection.So what's new in the Mark III Polisher? Improved Ergonomics. Larger Electronic Speed Control Dial. New Progressive trigger. Design refinements Superior Italian design will change the way you polish paintwork forever.The RUPES Mark III BigFoot Random Orbital Polisher sets the stage for 21st century detailing. RUPES, an Italian company that has been manufacturing precision tools since 1947, has developed the most high-tech polishers the world has ever seen. Over several years of research and development, BigFoot has redefined paint correction for the enthusiast and professional detailer. The innovative system allows for the smoothest and most efficient polishing experience. The RUPES Mark III Bigfoot Random Orbital Polisher uses superior Italian craftsmanship to create a tool that is built to last.Innovative design makes the LHR21 Mark III the perfect machine for large polishing jobs. The RUPES LHR21 BigFoot Mark III Random Orbital Polisher gets its name from its massive, industry leading 21mm orbit. Consider this: a conventional random orbital polisher has an orbit between 4 and 8mm.This gives the LHR 21 a huge advantage while working on large panels because it enables you to polish a significantly larger area, reducing your overall time and increasing profits This means you’ll be able to remove swirls, scratches, water spots and other paint defects in considerably less time. It is the perfectionist’s choice for swirl-free paint!The highly efficient motor of the Mark III BigFoot Random Orbital Polisher produces a speed range of 3000 to 4500 RPMs. The specially engineered motor, generates high levels of torque while requiring just 500 watts of input. This results in RUPES offering the most efficient motor in random orbital polishing today. The motor on these polishers are so efficient compared with other polishers on the market, performing better than these polishers that push up to 1100w.The RUPES LHR 21 utilizes a 6 inch hook and loop backing plate designed to accommodate 6.5 inch and 7 inch pads – perfect for polishing horizontal and large body panels.  The polisher ensures a perfect finish with its random orbital motion and exceptionally large throw. One of the biggest advantages of the LHR 21 is that no swirls or holograms are instilled into the paint as you polish. A conventional rotary/circular polisher, while very effective at polishing paint to remove defects, can leave swirls and holograms in the finish as a result of its direct drive, circular motion. Simply put, the RUPES LHR 21 BigFoot Mark III Random Orbital Polisher leaves you with a perfect finish that’s free of swirls and holograms – all without the risk of burning through the paint. It is so easy to use that even a novice can have the polisher mastered after only one panel!Improved Design ErgonomicsAttention to detail is something more than just attractive design. Subtle design refinements like the rubberized front grip which replaces the plastic, carbon-fibre like finish of the Mark II, offers exceptional comfort for the operator while providing a non-slip surface for control. The improved rear handle also integrates rubberized surfaces for improved feel. Two strategically placed top-mounted, non-marking rubber tool rests provide stability when the tool is on it's back and not in use,  as well as additional protection against unintended impact.New Progressive TriggerAdding an additional layer of control is the new progressive trigger. Acting as a throttle to control speeds within the dial range, the progressive trigger allows the operator to make subtle adjustments for precise control without interruption of the process or need to reposition the grip to access the speed dial.Larger Electronic Speed Control DialThe RUPES LHR21 Mark III Bigfoot Random Orbital Polisher features a new electronic speed control dial that is alot bigger, allowing operators to select the ideal speed for the task using your thumb, without any interruption to the polishing process. High visibility numbers and a more positive feedback from the movement of the dial make speed changes feel more deliberate.  LESS steps, LESS time, LESS compound consumption and GREATER profits Technical Specifications:   Velcro Pad mm 150   Polishing Pad Size Max. mm 180   Orbit mm 21   Power W 500   Speed Control √   Weight Kg 2.25   Revs R.P.M 3000-4700  Recommended Backing Pad:   Ø mm Interface Fitting Code   150mm Velcro M8 981.321  Downloads:   \t\t\tRUPES BigFoot Catalogue \t\t\tParts Diagram (181KB)   \n",

You must weld like for like plastic to achieve a structurally sound bond. Prepare the weld surface. Ensure it is clean of dust and dirt so that you can achieve an unobstructed plastic-to-plastic bond. Notch out a “V” groove along the crack or join. “Tacking” the join or crack together helps to secure the material in place to ensure there is stability and no misalignment of the joins. Run the tip of a tacking nozzle or heated metal item along the join to create an initial bond. Using a speed welding nozzle or by free hand pendulum welding technique, introduce the plastic weld rod to the weld zone. Ensure equal levels of hot air are directed at the plastic weld rod and the weld surface to ensure they reach “plasticity” at the same time. When the surface plastic shows signs of slight wetting, move the welding nozzle along the groove while at the same time applying downward pressure on the weld rod to ensure a sound bond.The below video shows the WELDY energy 1600 for welding PE, PP and PVC plastic sheets:Information sourced from https://carrmachines.co.nz\n",
